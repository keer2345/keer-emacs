;;; Commentary:

;; Among settings for many aspects of `org-mode', this code includes
;; an opinionated setup for the Getting Things Done (GTD) system based
;; around the Org Agenda.  I have an "inbox.org" file with a header
;; including

;;     #+CATEGORY: Inbox
;;     #+FILETAGS: INBOX

;; and then set this file as `org-default-notes-file'.  Captured org
;; items will then go into this file with the file-level tag, and can
;; be refiled to other locations as necessary.

;; Those other locations are generally other org files, which should
;; be added to `org-agenda-files-list' (along with "inbox.org" org).
;; With that done, there's then an agenda view, accessible via the
;; `org-agenda' command, which gives a convenient overview.
;; `org-todo-keywords' is customised here to provide corresponding
;; TODO states, which should make sense to GTD adherents.
